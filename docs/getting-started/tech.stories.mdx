## Tooling

**This projects's approach to developing (and iterating over) the user-interface is heavily inspired by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrost.com/)'s thinking on the subject of [Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/table-of-contents/) and the principles of [Style Guide Driven Development](http://www.styleguidedrivendevelopment.com/).**

In short:

> Design systems speed up your teamâ€™s workflow. Rather than reinventing the wheel every time a new request comes through, teams can reuse already established UI puzzle pieces to roll out new pages and features faster than ever before.

> \- [Atomic Design (2016)](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/chapter-4/)

This means that following tooling is included:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Styled Component](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### Storybook

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) a developer-facing framework that facilitates the development and testing of UI components seperate from an app's business logic. This allows the UI to be developed agnostic from the project's underlying logic, environment configurations and/or API end-points. The benefit of this is that developers/designers are not blocked or dependant on changes/finalisation of the internal configurations of the webapp itself.

### Material UI

**Material UI is React library that provides ready-to-use interactive and components.**

Furthermore, in the interest of development speed and overhead, the third-party [React component-based](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html) library called [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) has been pre-selected to underpin all React components in this project. [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) is an unofficial implementation of the [Material Design Spec](https://material.io/) (an extremely comprehensive and well-documented UI design system) for React. It is even recommended by the Material Design team themselves.

### Styled Components

**Styled Components is a library that enables React component to be styled via the common CSS syntax**

[Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) uses a CSS-in-JavaScript tool (called [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/)) under the hood. It exposes a built-in `withStyles()` method (as part of `@material-ui/core`) for overriding default [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) styling. At the same time, [Material UI](https://material-ui.com) is upfront about the fact that it is [completely interoperable with other CSS in JavaScript tooling](https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/). This project has (due to [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)'s support for interoperability) opted to use a [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) instead of the built-in Material UI [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/) hooks for the following reasons:

- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) has a massive online community compared to [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/).
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) is easier to read since no class names or `withStyles` composition are required.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) can be written in the regular CSS syntax (via [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)).
- [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) can be used to lint [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) styling.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) supports [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) logic out of the box.
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) supports global [CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors) out of the box.

Note that the following conventions should be applied when using Styled Component in this project:

1. **Consistency**: For the sake of consistency and readability, all styling should be done via [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) (even if not override default [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) styling).

2. **Simplicity**: Although [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) contains a [ThemeProvider component](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced), it is recommended that this not be used since it impacts CSS readability with little benefit since most of the theming is already handled by [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

3. **Specificity**: If you are overriding existing [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) styles you need to increase the [CSS-specificity of the overriding styling](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity). Avoid using `!important` in favour of a built-in [Styled Components specificity operator](https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#controlling-priority) (`&&`).

4. **Going Deeper**: If you wish to Style a [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) element not exposed via the Material UI root API of the component, please use a combination of the `classes` [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) attribute and [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com) nesting. This is further explained in the [Material UI Documentation](https://material-ui.com/guides/interoperability/#deeper-elements).

### TypeScript

**TypeScript is a [super-set programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) built on top of JavaScript. This means that all JavaScript expressions are still valid in Typescript, however Typescript adds additional [type-checking functionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system) on top of JavaScript.**

Note that TypeScript parsing is implemented via [Babel 7](https://babeljs.io/) (a JavaScript transpiler) and not via the [native TypeScript compiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript#Compiler). There are several benefits to this:

- Using Babel adheres to the single [responsibility principle (SRP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) insofar that we are not mixing several concerns into a single tool (i.e. both transpilation and type-checking/linting).
- Babel is noticably faster since we are no longer parsing types while doing hot-reloading (we are merely converting the syntax into regular JavaScript).
- By it's very nature Babel is more flexable and modular when it comes to project configuration, given that it is build with third-party plugins/presets in mind.

In addition, also note that ESLint is used in this project. [TSLint has been deprecated by Palantir](https://medium.com/palantir/tslint-in-2019-1a144c2317a9) (the team maintaining it), and ESLint is now seen as the defacto TypeScrit linting tool going forward.
