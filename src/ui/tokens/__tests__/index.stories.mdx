# Tokens

The term 'token' or 'design token' is used in this project in accordance with general UI parlance, as outlined by the Salesforce team in their [Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/). I.e:

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

These include things like colors, font-sizes, spacing and border-radii. You can think of these as things that would have previously been stored in `.scss` variables (for example: `$primary_color: '#aacc88'`).
